questL08Trapper	Am I my Trapper's Keeper?	The Council wants you to go talk to the Trapper on Mt. McLargeHuge. Mt. McLargeHuge is, unsurprisingly, in the Big Mountains.	The Trapper would like for you to gather up some cheese and ore for him so he can fix his ski lift.  You're not exactly sure where the cheese comes in.	The Trapper would like you to investigate the summit of Mt. McLargeHuge, but you'll need to find some way to protect yourself from the cold.  Perhaps the punk-ass kids on the eXtreme Slope could be persuaded, through the application of violence, to give you some of their warm duds.	You're ready to ascend to the Icy Peak of Mt. McLargeHuge and investigate the source of all the chaos and mists and whatnot.	You're really very close to figuring out what's going on at the Icy Peak of Mt. McLargeHuge...	You have slain Groar, the source of the mists and chaos.  Take his fur back to the Trapper, who is sure to give you some sort of reward.	You have helped the Trapper, and brought (relatively speaking) peace to Mt. McLargeHuge.  Shazam!
questL09Topping	There Can Be Only One Topping	The Council has gotten word that there's something bothering Black Angus, the Highland Lord.<p>You should seek him out, in the Highlands beyond the Orc Chasm, in the Big Mountains.	You've built a bridge over the Orc Chasm, and now you should go talk to Black Angus, the Highland Lord.<p>He's in a tower in the Highlands.  It's in the Big Mountains, past the Orc Chasm.	The Highland Lord wants you to light his three signal fires in the Highlands.	You've lit all the signal fires! Go see Black Angus, the Highland Lord, in his tower in the Highlands.	You helped Black Angus, the Highland Lord, get a pizza delivered to his stupid tower in the stupid Highlands.  Yaaaaay.
questL10Garbage	The Rain on the Plains is Mainly Garbage	The Council of Loathing wants you to investigate the source of the giant garbage raining down on the Nearby Plains.	You have stopped the rain of giant garbage in the Nearby Plains. Slick!
questL11MacGuffin	<Player Name> and the Quest for the Holy MacGuffin	The Council has instructed you to collect your father's archaeology notes from Distant Lands, and use them to hunt down the Holy MacGuffin. Your first step is to find the Black Market, to get some forged ID.	You've found the Black Market... now to hit the Travel Agency and get yourself on a slow boat to China. I mean, Distant Lands.	You've picked up your father's diary, and things just got a whole lot more complicated. Oh dear.	You've handed the Holy MacGuffin over to the Council, and enjoyed a ticker-tape parade in your honor. That quest was so ridiculous, it wasn't even funny, and now it's over! Hooray!
questL11Worship	Gotta Worship Them All	You father seemed to think the hidden temple in the Distant Woods might be guarding part of the Staff of Ed. I hope you've got your lucky fedora with you.	You've cunningly evaded one of the Hidden Temple's traps. But what else lies in store? cue ominous music	Having proved that you ain't no hollaback girl, there's just one more trap to go. Pity dad never got around to translating that last passage...	Awesome, you've evaded all of the temple's traps! Of course, it turned out that getting the piece of the Staff of Ed isn't going to be nearly that easy, but you were probably expecting that anyway. If you weren't, well, sorry.	You've defeated the ancient ghost of an ancient mummy of an ancient high priest and claimed his ancient amulet! Go you!
questL11Manor	In a Manor of Spooking	Your father's notes indicate that the gem from the Staff of Ed is probably hidden in a Seaside Town mansion. At a guess, you figure Spookyraven Manor is probably your best bet.	You've unlocked the wine cellar in Spookyraven Manor. What are the chances there's a secret door hidden somewhere? Yeah, probably about one in one.	You've found Lord Spookyraven's secret black magic laboratory. When you're done with him, he'll be doing black and blue magic.	You defeated Lord Spookyraven and recovered the Eye of Ed.  Huzzah!
questL11Palindome	Never Odd Or Even	If you're going to get the Staff of Fats, it looks like the first step is to get into the Palindome. Maybe it has something to do with that amulet your father mentioned in his diary? That password looks important, too.	Congratulations, you've discovered the fabulous Palindome, rumored to be the final resting place of the legendary Staff of Fats! Now all you have to do is find it...	Well, you found the Staff of Fats, but then you lost it again. Good going. Looks like you're going to have to track down this Mr. Alarm guy for help...	Mr. Alan Alarm has agreed to help you nullify Dr. Awkward's ineptitude field (patent pending), but wants some wet stew in return. Those ingredients again: lion oil, a bird rib, and some stunt nuts. Sounds delicious!	Oh yeah, you've got the Mega Gem, and are ready to deliver some pain to Dr. Awkward. They call you the bus driver, because you're gonna beat the hell out of that guy.	Congratulations, you've recovered the long-lost Staff of Fats!<p>Nice Work!
questL11Pyramid	A Pyramid Scheme	Your father's diary indicates that the key to finding the Holy MacGuffin is hidden somewhere in the desert. I hope you've got your walking shoes on.	You've managed to stumble upon a hidden oasis out in the desert. That should help make your desert explorations a little less... dry.	The fremegn leader Gnasir has tasked you with finding a stone rose, at his abandoned encampment near the oasis. Apparently it's an ancient symbol of his tribe or something, I dunno, whatever. He's not gonna help you unless you get it for him, though.	Gnasir has asked you to prove your honor and dedication to the tribe by painting his front door black. A menial task to be sure, but at least it's not dangerous.<p>Well, unless you're really allergic to paint fumes or something.	Gnasir seemed satisfied with the tasks you performed for his tribe, and has asked you to come back later.<p>...<p>Okay, that's probably long enough.	For your worm-riding training, you need to find a 'thumper', something that produces a rhythmic vibration to summon sandworms.<p>It's unlikely that we're talking about bunny rabbits here.	You need to find fifteen missing pages from Gnasir's worm-riding manual. Have fun!	One worm-riding manual page down, fourteen to go.	Two worm-riding manual pages down, thirteen to go. Sigh.	You've found all of Gnasir's missing manual pages. Time to take them back to the sietch.	You've earned your hooks and are ready to ride the worm. Literally, not in the South-of-the-Border sense.	One excitingly-described worm-ride later, you've found the little pyramid with the map of Seaside Town inside. Looks like you're going to need the Staff of Ed to get the location of the Holy MacGuffin's hiding place.	You've found the hidden buried pyramid that guards the Holy MacGuffin. You're so close you can almost taste it! (In a figurative sense, I mean -- I don't recommend you go around licking things you find in ancient tombs.)	The mighty Ed the Undying has fallen! You recovered the Holy MacGuffin! Jolly good show, mate!
questL11Shen	Of Mice and Shen		You retrieved half of the Talisman o' Nam from Shen Copperhead. Nice!
questL11Ron	Merry-Go-Ron		You recovered half of the Talisman o' Nam from Ron Copperhead. Brilliant!
questL12War	Make War, Not... Oh, Wait	The Council has gotten word of tensions building between the hippies and the frat boys on the Mysterious Island of Mystery.<p>They suspect that the two factions are about to go to war, and they want to make sure it's a big war. They want you to head down there and see if you can't stir up some trouble.	You've managed to get the war between the hippies and frat boys started, and now the Council wants you to finish it.<p>You can aid the war effort by fighting on the Battlefield, or you can help out some of the other residents of the island in the hopes that they'll aid the side you're fighting for.	You led the filthy hippies to victory in the Great War. For Gaia!	You led the Orcish frat boys to victory in the Great War. For The Horde!	You started a chain of events that led the pirates to annihilate both the hippies and the frat boys in the Great War. Toasty!
questL13Final	The Final Ultimate Epic Final Conflict	The Council of Loathing has instructed you to make your way to the top of the Naughty Sorceress' Tower and defeat her.<p>Inside the entrance to the Lair, you've encountered three strange gates. An inscription provides a clue on how you might pass through them...	Having made it through the three gates, you've encountered a giant mirror that blocks your way deeper into the Lair.	You've come to an odd junction in the cave leading to the Sorceress' Lair. It seems that in order to proceed, you'll need to solve a really convoluted and contrived puzzle involving a cloud of gas, a locked door, and three statues of mariachis.	The Council of Loathing has instructed you to make your way to the top of the Naughty Sorceress' Tower and defeat her. Currently, you're stuck in a hedge maze, Don't beat around the bush, get through it!	You've passed through the gates, solved a fiendish puzzle, beat the hedge maze like a psychotic landscaper, and now you're facing a fiendish monster on the	You've solved many puzzles, and now are confronted with the most frustrating puzzle yet. Can you figure out the code to get through the heavy door?	You're almost to the final epic showdown battle countdown of fate and destiny and whatnot! Get in there and kick some tail!	You thought you were finally going to fight the Sorceress, but you're still stuck battling her minions. This one seems to be a shadowy, evil version of you, except it doesn't have a goatee.	You find yourself fighting one of the Sorceress's freakishly overgrown familiars. What is she feeding them, anyway?	This is it, sparky -- the big showdown with the Naughty Sorceress. I just wanted to say, "good luck - we're all counting on you."	You have defeated the Naughty Sorceress! Whoohoo! You left the king in his prism, though.	You have defeated the Naughty Sorceress and freed the King! What are you hanging around here for?

# Guild Quests
questG01Meatcar	My Other Car Is Made of Meat	Since your Guild's meat car has been lost due to somewhat sketchy circumstances, you need to build a new one. You might be able to find some parts at Degrassi Knoll.	You've built a new meat car from parts. Impressive!
questG02Whitecastle	<Player Name> and <Familiar Name> Go To White Citadel	You've been charged by your Guild (sort of) with the task of bringing back a delicious meal from the legendary White Citadel. You've been told it's somewhere near Whitey's Grove, in the Distant Woods.	You've discovered the road from Whitey's Grove to the legendary White Citadel. You should explore it and see if you can find your way.	You're progressing down the road towards the White Citadel, but you'll need to find something that can help you get past that stupid cheetah if you're going to make it any further. Keep looking around.	You've made your way further down the Road to the White Citadel, but you still haven't found it. Keep looking!	You've found the White Citadel, but it's at the bottom of a huge cliff. You should keep messing around on the Road until you find a way to get down the cliff.

questG03Ego	The Wizard of Ego	You've been tasked with digging up the grave of an ancient and powerful wizard and bringing back a key that was buried with him. What could possibly go wrong?	Well, you got the key and turned it in -- mission accomplished. How much do you wanna bet, though, that they won't be able to find anyone else to search the tower, and you'll be stuck with the dirty work again?	Much as you expected, you've been given back the key to Fernswarthy's tower and ordered to investigate.	You've unlocked Fernswarthy's tower. Now you just have to find something to show your guild leaders, to prove you haven't just been slacking off this whole time.	You've found some stairs in Fernswarthy's tower, but they don't lead to much. Better keep looking.	You've found a trapdoor to Fernswarthy's basement, which is potentially interesting and/or dangerous. It's probably not what your Guild is interested in, though, so you should probably keep looking.	You found some kind of dusty old book in Fernswarthy's tower. Hopefully that's enough to keep that guy in your guild off your case.	You've turned in the old book, and they said they didn't want it and for you to go away. A bit anticlimactic, but I suppose it still counts as a success. Congratulations!
questG04Nemesis	Me and My Nemesis	One of your guild leaders has tasked you to recover a mysterious and unnamed artifact stolen by your Nemesis.

Now the people of the Kingdom of Loathing are safe from whatever horrible (and probably really gross) scheme it was that Lumpy had in store! Your mother must be very proud of you. Well done!	Despite being aided by <demon name>, the Demonic Lord of Revenge, the Spirit of New Wave has fallen beneath your mighty assault. Now the disco-loving people of the Kingdom of Loathing are free to groove the night away, safe from his insidious machinations! Your mother must be very proud of you. Well done!	Despite being aided by <demon name>, the Demonic Lord of Revenge, the dread mariachi Somerset Lopez has fallen beneath your mighty assault. Now the eons-long war between the Accordion Thieves and the mariachis is finally at an end, and the streets of the Kingdom of Loathing are safe for cat-burglars and sneak-thieves like yourself and your cronies! Your mother must be very proud of you. Well done!
questG05Dark	A Dark and Dank and Sinister Quest	Finally it's time to meet this Nemesis you've been hearing so much about! The guy at your guild has marked your map with the location of a cave in the Big Mountains, where your Nemesis is supposedly hiding.	Your Nemesis has scuttled away in defeat, leaving you with a sweet Epic Hat and a feeling of smug superiority. Well done you!
questG06Delivery	<Player Name>'s Delivery Service	A guy in your guild has offered you some meat if you'll grab his package for him.<p>Oh stop laughing, you know perfectly well what I mean! Honestly...<p>Anyway, you should be able to find it in the 7-Foot Dwarves' factory complex, which can supposedly be reached through their mine.	You've successfully delivered a package, and been rewarded with an amount of meat that was more-or-less proportional to the difficulty of the task. Hooray! Of course, there's obviously a bit more going on in that factory, but whether or not you want to mess around with all that is up to you.
