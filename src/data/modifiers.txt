# Synergies section of modifiers.txt
# Synergies are triggered when an arbitrary combination of two or more
# equipment items, passive skills, active effects, campground items, or
# a specific outfit are present.  They can't depend on your familiar or
# its equipment, to allow the possibility of a familiar weight modifier.
# The name of the synergy is split into elements using whatever character
# immediately follows "synergy": this should obviously be something that
# doesn't appear in any of the element names.
# Each element of the synergy must appear earlier in this file (even if
# it has no enchantments itself), with a "Synergetic" flag.
# There is currently a limit of 32 total Synergetic items.

# Maximization categories section of modifiers.txt
# These pseudo-items list the indirect benefits of certain classes of

# have a positive score, the items in that class will be considered as
# possibilities even if their direct benefits wouldn't qualify them.
# The exact values don't really matter, just their sign.
