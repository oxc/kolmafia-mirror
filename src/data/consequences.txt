# Format:
#	type <tab> spec <tab> regex <tab> action [ <tab> action ]...
#
# type is one of:
#	DESC_ITEM - spec is an item name, regex is applied to its description.
#	DESC_SKILL - spec is a skill name, regex is applied to its description.
#	DESC_EFFECT - spec is an effect name, regex is applied to its description.
#	MONSTER - spec is a KoL monster name, regex is applied to the initial combat
#		page.  The first text action replaces the monster's name.
#
# The currently defined actions are:
#	"text" - returns a text value.  Normally this would just be printed, but some
#		consequence types may define some other meaning for text actions.
#	name=value - set a preference.
#	anything else - assumed to be a text action.  Not safe for text that starts
#		with a punctuation mark, or contains an equal sign; quote it to be sure.
#
# Two levels of text substitution are performed on actions:
#	1. A $ followed by a digit is replaced by the corresponding numbered group
#		in the regex match.
#	2. Text enclosed in [square brackets] is interpreted as a modifier
#		expression, and replaced with the resulting value.
#		See modifiers.txt for full details, although only the basic math
#		operators are expected to be useful here.
